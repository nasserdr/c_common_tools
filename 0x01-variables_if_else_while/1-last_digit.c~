This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is

*You can find the source code here
*The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
*You dont have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do 
*not touch this code
*The output of the program should be:
*The string Last digit of, followed by
*n, followed by
*the string is, followed by
*if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
*if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 
*and not 0 followed by a new line
